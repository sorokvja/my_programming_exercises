# my_programming_exercises
C, Python, and whoever knows what else to be added in the future.  


The main goal of performing the exercises was to learn and enhance understanding of how certain languages function. 
While performing certain exercises, it sometimes was assumed that only appropriate values are passed to the functions, and safe-cheks were not implemented in certain cases. Though those are undoubtedly important, sometimes understanding of certain "feature" was considered more important "within a moment". 

In general, this repo stores a set of various functions, categorized by a topic. This repo **DOES NOT** contain functioning programms.
